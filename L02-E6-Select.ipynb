    "# Selecting Columns\n",
    "\n",
    "The select() function is simple, in that, you provide a comma separated list of columns and only those columns are selected. Practice makes perfect. Let’s revisit the select() function and work with some of its helper functions to be able to select the columns we are looking for. In a prior exercise, we explored the basic select() operation, namely, provide it a list of columns and only those columns are returned in a data frame, in that order. Often times, we aren’t selecting columns just to remove columns we don’t need, but rather selecting columns that we need to do some additional data wrangling or cleansing with such as data type conversion. This makes selecting columns a much more common task than just part of the data import process. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will explore some additional time-saving features select() provides. \n",
    "Admittedly, the dataset we are working with have only several columns. As a result, some functions we won't be able to cover, and all this might seem a bit trivial. In practice, however, there can be data frames with hundreds or thousands of columns. Managing these manually would be painful. Often, these thousand-column data frames have some patterns in their column names. Maybe they end with a 3-digit number, or maybe the date columns end with _date. We can exploit these patterns. Being able to more programmatically select the columns of interest will become more important in these cases. After all, we are in a programming environment, so let’s take advantage of it.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also use regular expressions. Regular Expressions is a popular method for text pattern matching that is implemented in many programming languages. Full coverage is outside the scope of this course. It is used briefly in this exercise to make you aware of it and it will show up more, later in the course. Just know that R makes extensive use of regular expressions and is the default for most text matching functions. So be careful when trying to match symbols as they may be interpreted as regular expression modifiers.\n",
