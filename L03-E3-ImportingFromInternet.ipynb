    "Now that we know how to import flat files locally, what about directly from the Internet? Although manually downloading a file to your local computer is not difficult, there are times when importing directly from the Internet would be helpful. To illustrate this, let me introduce the UCI machine learning repository. University of California Irvine hosts a machine learning repository containing many real-world data sets. As luck would have it, they have a fuel economy automotive dataset. \n",
    "\n",
    "The same tidyverse import function read_csv() can be used to import from a URL. We just replace the local filename with a URL string.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, we will import this UCI data and then do a bit of visual data analysis on it. I hope you havenâ€™t forgotten your ggplot skills. This data is a bit messier, which makes for a great learning opportunity. First, the header data is stored separately. I created an Excel spreadsheet with this info, so we will have to import this and combine the headers from the spreadsheet to the UCI automotive data. \n",
    "\n",
    "After we have a data frame containing the data, we will analyze highway miles per gallon vs engine displacement. This is an opportunity to reinforce your filtering, piping, and plotting skills. See if you can do it without any hints by looking at the prior exercises and applying it to this new data set. If you need hints, they are also provided later in this notebook and of course the solution notebook is available.\n",
