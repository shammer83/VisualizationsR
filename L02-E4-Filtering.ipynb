Being able to filter rows and columns becomes commonplace in data analysis. Fortunately, this is an area of strength for the tidyverse and a package is dedicated to this named, dplyr. \n",

    "We will start simple with select(), filter() and arrange(). \n",
    "•\tselect() chooses the columns you want to keep and optionally rename them. \n",

    "•\tarrange() sorts the rows based upon the columns you give it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply put, select() discards columns, filter() discards rows, and arrange sorts rows. For those that are familiar with SQL, these three functions are similar to SQL SELECT, WHERE, and ORDER BY.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will also include some base R functions, head(), and tail(). \n",
    "head() will return the first 6 rows of a data set and tail() the last 6. 6 is the default value. You can override that parameter with the value you want. Combining head() and tail() with arrange() can return the top important rows for your analsyis.\n",
