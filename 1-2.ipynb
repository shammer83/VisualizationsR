Scatterplots are useful to show the relationship between two variables. It is good practice to explore all the data variables available in the dataset. There are other variables that are related to the size of the engine. \n",

    "We’ll look at these variables to see if they reveal any new information. Using the same datasets, mtcars and mpg, we will deepen our understanding of the functions you previously used, namely library(), glimpse(), ggplot() and geom_point(). We will also introduce comments, a key feature to making your code more human readable, including your future self.\n",
