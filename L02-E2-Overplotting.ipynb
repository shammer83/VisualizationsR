This is especially the case plotting discrete or categorical variables in a scatterplot. \n",

    "One way to see more of the points and avoid them being plotted on top of each other is to move them around a small random amount. ggplot calls this jitter. We will jitter the data a bit. Ironically, we are changing the data making it less accurate in order to more accurately analyze it visually. Many geoms have a jitter parameter, but since it is so common for scatterplots, it got its own geom for that, geom_jitter().  It is shorthand for geom_point() with the jitter parameter active. I find the code is easier to read when I use a specialized geom as compared to a parameter to a more generic geom.\n",
