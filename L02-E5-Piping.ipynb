    "We will take the opportunity to see how the previous exercise can benefit from using the pipe syntax. Since our code is pretty simple right now, the readability might not be that improved by using the pipe. But as more and more function calls are nested, the benefits of the pipe become obvious. \n",

    "Since the tidyverse was built with the pipe in mind, it works well with the pipe. A notable exception is ggplot, which was created before standardizing on the pipe, and thus it has its own type of pipe operator, the plus sign.
