    "## Two sample hypothesis testing for comparing two means\n",
    "### Two-sided tests\n",
    "In L07-1, we saw a **two-sided** hypothesis test for inference about population means of two groups, based on samples from the two groups. It's two-sided because the null hypothesis is rejected if the first sample mean is sufficiently larger OR sufficiently smaller than the second sample mean. In other words, we are **not** specifying which mean we expect to be larger. \n",
    "\n",
    "Null hypothesis:  \n",
    "$H_0: \\mu_A = \\mu_B$\n",
    "\n",
    "(Note that this is the same as $\\mu_A - \\mu_B = 0$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Alternative hypothesis (two-sided):  \n",
    "$H_A: \\mu_A \\ne \\mu_B$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**Assumptions: **\n",
    "* Two normally distributed independent populations\n",
    "* Population variances are unknown and not assumed to be equal   \n",
    "\n",
    "As we saw in L07-1, the **t-statistic** for comparing two means is:  \n",
    "$t=\\frac{\\bar{x_1} - \\bar{x_2}}{\\sqrt{s_1^2/n_1+s_2^2/n_2}}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The two-sided test has \"rejection regions\" in the two tails of the normal distribution of the difference in group means. Extreme positive values of the t-statistic are in the upper rejection region, and extreme negative values are in the lower rejection region. Typically the \"cutoff\" values of these regions are set to make the probability in each region .025, so the total probability is .05.      \n",
    "\n",
    "If the p-value for the test is **less than** .05, we **reject** the null hypothesis (which is our default hypothesis). Otherwise, we **fail to reject** the null hypothesis. The \"fail to reject\" language indicates that the data don't provide enough evidence to reject the default. In L07-1, we used the R function pt() to determine the p-value for the two-sided test. \n",
    "\n",
    "A very commonly used R function for performing hypothesis tests is **t.test()**. Let's see how to do the example from L07-1 with t.test().\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example: **\n",
    "Question: Is there a statistically significant difference in **mean sale prices** between Old Town & Somerst neighborhoods?  \n",
