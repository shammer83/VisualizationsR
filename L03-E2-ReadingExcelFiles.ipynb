    "# Reading Excel Files\n",
    "\n",
    "Excel is a common type of source data. It can get a bit messy if that Excel file was generated by a human rather than an automated process, but this is a welcomed data wrangling challenge. There are times when things are going all wrong that I simply open up the Excel file, make any edits or column formatting changes, and save as CSV. There, now I have a CSV file that I can easily import. \n",
    "\n",
    "That is a last resort. R has numerous ways to import Excel files just as it does for flat files. In fact, there are packages that both read AND write to Excel. Yes, you can programmatically edit Excel using R. In this course, however, we will stick to the tidyverse Excel import which is pretty simple and basic, but the package is under active development so more features are coming.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this exercise, you will read in Excel files, both the older xls format and the newer xlsx format. We will use the readxl package. It was developed by Hadley Wickham, the same author of the readr package we used in the prior exercise, so the syntax will be familiar. readxl doesn't load with the tidyverse so we will have load the package with its own library command.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are only two functions in the readxl package at this time. excel_sheets() and read_excel(). The first returns a list of sheet names for a given file. The second returns a data frame for a given Excel file and sheet. Pretty simple.\n",
    "The readxl package comes with two example files. We'll take this opportunity to learn how to find and copy these files to our current working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will then use excel_sheets() to get a list of sheet names and use that with read_excel() to load sheets into R data frames.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two read_csv features I miss the most that are not yet in read_excel(). The first is the ability to distinguish between double and integer data types. The second is trimming whitespace. Both of these tasks can easily be performed after they are in a data frame. We'll see how to convert to integer in this exercise and we'll leave string manipulation to a later exercise. Read_csv does both of these things by default. What I find myself doing is reading in the excel file, exporting to csv and reading the csv back in. Then I get all the features I was missing from read_excel(). Call me lazy, but all but the biggest Excel sheets can perform this double import in under a second. Anything that saves me some data wrangling time is good in my book.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will import an Excel file where the user (okay it was me pretending to be a user) filtered the data on two different Excel table sheets to different years. We import both sheets. After we get two data frames, one for the rows from year 1999 and the other for year 2008, we combine them together using bind_rows() a handy tidyverse dplyr function. This is similar to SQL UNION ALL. If you had a number of spreadsheets where the columns are all the same but filtered by some variable, R can do a great job automating the combining of this data into a single data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "We then tackle a more challenging FORMATTED spreadsheet that has a merged cell title and some empty rows and columns as well as some miscellaneous manual cell formatting and notes outside of the main table of data. These manually prettified spreadsheets can be more challenging to deal with and don't load in very well by default. The default import will \"shrink-wrap\" the spreadsheet into an enclosing rectangle that contains all of the information, which includes the title at the top of the sheet and any other straggling non-empty cells. The idea is that it is not ignoring any data from the sheet, thus you get a mess of string columns and missing values all over the placeâ€¦.but all the data from the sheet is technically in a data frame. Skipping the first few rows and using select() to get the subset of columns, allowed us to recover the original data set quite easily, much easier than wrangling an out-of-control data frame we would have had.\n",
